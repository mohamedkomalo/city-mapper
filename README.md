City Mapper
===========
A practice on software design given in my orange internship. 

#The Problem
You are given a file with the country description as a graph representation with the node represents a city and the edge
represents a path between two cities and the weighting of the edge represents the distance between the two cities. 
There is no self-edge (source city not equals the destination city).
The edges are directed. 
You are given a set of queries and you have to answer them.
